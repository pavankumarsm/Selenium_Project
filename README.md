# Selenium_Project

## 1. Project Overview  
This repository (“Selenium_Project”) is an automation testing framework built using Selenium WebDriver and Java. The goal is to provide a reusable, scalable test automation setup following best practices (e.g. Page Object Model, TestNG, data-driven testing) to verify web application functionality. It is intended for QA engineers, developers, or automation enthusiasts to run cross-browser tests, maintain scalable test suites, and easily extend with new test cases.

## 3. Setup Instructions  

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites  
- Java JDK (version 8, 11, or above) installed and `JAVA_HOME` set  
- Apache Maven installed and available in your `PATH`  
- Browser drivers (e.g. ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver) compatible with current browser version  
- (Optional but recommended) An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse  


## 4. Project Overview  
This repository is an automation testing framework built using **Selenium WebDriver** and **Java**.  
The goal is to provide a **reusable, scalable test automation setup** following best practices (Page Object Model, TestNG, utilities) to verify web application functionality.  
It helps QA engineers and developers execute automated test cases across browsers and environments efficiently.

## 5. Operational Framework  

### Purpose and Functionality  
The project automates the testing of web applications, ensuring they behave as expected across browsers.  
It provides modular test scripts, configuration-driven execution, and clear reporting.

### Core Components  
- **Test Scripts** – Validate application business logic (written with TestNG).  
- **Page Object Model (POM)** – Encapsulates page locators and actions for reusability.  
- **WebDriver Setup** – Launches and controls browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).  
- **TestNG Framework** – Orchestrates test execution, grouping, prioritization, and reporting.  
- **Utility Classes** – Helper methods for waits, screenshots, and advanced interactions.  
- **Configuration Management** – Externalizes environment settings (URLs, browsers, timeouts).  
- **Reports** – HTML/XML reports generated under `test-output/`.  

### Workflow / Interaction  
1. **Test Execution Triggered** – via Maven (`mvn test`) or TestNG XML suite.  
2. **Configuration Setup** – Reads browser/environment settings and initializes WebDriver.  
3. **Test Initialization** – Opens browser and navigates to base URL.  
4. **Test Execution** – TestNG executes test scripts using Page Objects and utilities.  
5. **Validation** – Assertions check expected vs actual results; screenshots captured on failure.  
6. **Teardown** – Browser sessions closed, resources released.  
7. **Reporting** – Test results generated in `test-output/`.  

### Key Stages  
- **Setup** – Install dependencies, configure drivers.  
- **Execution** – Run test suite via TestNG/Maven.  
- **Validation** – Assertions ensure business rules are met.  
- **Reporting** – View results in reports folder.  
- **Maintenance** – Update Page Objects/tests for UI or business changes.  

This structure makes the framework **scalable, maintainable, and adaptable**, aligning with the project’s goal of delivering robust test automation.
